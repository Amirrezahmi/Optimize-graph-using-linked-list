# Optimize-graph-using-linked-list
Graph algorithms solve problems on graphs: collections of nodes connected by edges. They find paths, spanning trees, and detect cycles. Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree. It sorts edges by weight, adds them to the tree while avoiding cycles. We optimize by using linked-list-based adjacency lists.
